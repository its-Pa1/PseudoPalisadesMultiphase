# PseudoPalisadesMultiphase

Welcome to this GitHub repository, which houses the code corresponding to the paper titled "Deciphering Oxygen Distribution and Hypoxia Profiles in the Tumor Microenvironment: A Data-Driven Mechanistic Modeling Approach", DOI: https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/mine.2022049, and Chapter 4 of the thesis titled "Diss_Kumar_Pawan.pdf" present in the parent directory, available at https://kluedo.ub.rptu.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/6573.

## Key Features

The codebase encompasses a variety of functionalities, including:

- 1D and 2D simulations of tumor microenvironment models
- Numerical solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDE)
- Generation of plots and videos for simulation results

## Project Structure

### 1D_nondim
This directory contains the codes and results for the figures 4.10 in the thesis. It includes:

- `main_nondim.m`: Main script for 1D simulations
- `MPM_1D_nondim.avi` and `MPM_1D_nondim.mp4`: Video results
- `Plots_pattern/`: Directory for plot results
- `readme.txt`: Detailed description of the scripts and methods used

### 2D_nondim
This directory contains the codes and results for the figures 4.1-4.9 in the thesis. It includes:

- `main_2D.m` and `main_2D_III.m`: Main scripts for 2D simulations
- `compare_chi_three_occ.m`, `compare_K_equal.m`, etc.: Scripts for specific comparisons and computations
- `Plots_diff_chi_double/`, `Plots_diff_chi_zero/`, `Plots_diff_K_equal_I/`, `Plots_diff_K_equal_II/`: Directories for plot results
- `readme.txt`: Detailed description of the scripts and methods used

### main_all_chap4.m
This script runs all the main files involved to produce the above-mentioned simulation results (included in Chapter 4 of the thesis).
